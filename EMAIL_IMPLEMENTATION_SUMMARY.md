   - SMTP integration
   - Supports Gmail, SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.
   - HTML + Plain text support

3. **Supabase Realtime**
   - Listens to database changes
   - Triggers email events
   - Real-time processing

## 🚀 Setup Overview

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+
- SMTP account (Gmail/SendGrid/Mailgun)
- Supabase project

### Quick Setup
1. Install dependencies: `cd email-service && npm install`
2. Configure `.env` with SMTP and Supabase credentials
3. Run database migration in Supabase
4. Start service: `npm start`
5. Test with `/test-email` endpoint

**Full details**: See `EMAIL_SETUP_GUIDE.md`

## 📧 SMTP Provider Options

### Option 1: Gmail (Free)
- **Pros**: Free, easy setup, reliable
- **Cons**: Daily sending limits, requires app password
- **Best for**: Development, small-scale production

### Option 2: SendGrid (Freemium)
- **Pros**: 100 emails/day free, good deliverability, dedicated IPs
- **Cons**: Requires signup, verification
- **Best for**: Production, higher volume

### Option 3: Mailgun (Freemium)
- **Pros**: 5,000 emails/month free, excellent API, good analytics
- **Cons**: Requires domain verification
- **Best for**: Production, API-first approach

### Option 4: Amazon SES (Pay-as-you-go)
- **Pros**: Very cheap ($0.10/1000 emails), highly scalable
- **Cons**: More complex setup, requires AWS account
- **Best for**: High-volume production

## 🔐 Security Features

- ✅ Environment variables for sensitive data
- ✅ Service role key used (not anon key)
- ✅ RLS policies on email_settings and email_logs
- ✅ Only admins can view/modify settings
- ✅ Email logs include metadata for auditing
- ✅ No sensitive data in email templates

## 📊 Monitoring & Debugging

### Check if Service is Running
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

### View Recent Emails
```sql
SELECT * FROM email_logs 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 20;
```

### Check Failed Emails
```sql
SELECT * FROM email_logs 
WHERE status = 'failed'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### View Email Settings
```sql
SELECT * FROM email_settings;
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Emails not sending
**Solution**: Check SMTP credentials, verify email service is running, review logs

### Issue: Emails going to spam
**Solution**: Configure SPF/DKIM records, use reputable SMTP provider, avoid spam words

### Issue: Realtime not triggering
**Solution**: Enable Supabase Realtime replication for tables, check service role key

### Issue: Email service crashes
**Solution**: Check Node.js version, verify all dependencies installed, review error logs

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- **Asynchronous**: All emails sent without blocking main app
- **Queue-based**: Handles high volumes gracefully
- **Rate limiting**: Respects SMTP provider limits
- **Error handling**: Failed emails logged, can be retried
- **Scalable**: Can be deployed separately for horizontal scaling
