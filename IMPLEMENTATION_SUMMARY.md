# KaziBORA Authentication & User Roles - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema & Security
**File:** `supabase-setup.sql`

  - Updated `jobs` table with `employer_id` foreign key

- **Row Level Security (RLS):**
  - Profiles: Public read, self-update, admin full access

## 📋 What's Different from MVP

### Before (MVP):
- No authentication
- No user accounts
- Anyone could post/edit/delete jobs
- No application tracking
- No user-specific features

### After (With Auth):
- ✅ User accounts with roles
- ✅ Protected routes
- ✅ Role-based dashboards
- ✅ Job ownership
- ✅ Application system
- ✅ Bookmark/save jobs
- ✅ User management (admin)
- ✅ Secure data access
- ✅ Application status tracking

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Setup:**
   ```bash
   # Run the SQL script in Supabase
   # Ensure .env has Supabase credentials
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Create First Admin:**
   ```sql
   -- Sign up normally first, then:
   UPDATE profiles SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'your@email.com';
   ```

3. **Test the Flow:**
   - Sign up as job seeker → Browse → Apply → Check dashboard
   - Sign up as employer → Post job → Manage jobs
   - Login as admin → Manage everything
